# React component library with storybook, tailwind and anything else that seems useful

A step by step investigation to figure out how to build a react component library that can be published.
Note, this is more about the wiring that an actual useful UI library.

## Notes

### General

* Dear god! The node ecosystem. Why does nothing just work?
* And why does each version of something work differently?

### React

* Didn't use a template. Just included the packages

### Storybook

* Used `npx sb init`

### Tailwind

* I just really like tailwind...

### Rollup

### Typescript

* Used `npx tsc init`
* Using `baseUrl` cos it looks nice but it isn't half fiddly

### NextJs

*
